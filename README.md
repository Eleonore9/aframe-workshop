# A-Frame workshop

I followed an AR workshop at MozFest 2019. See the tutorial [here](https://github.com/edsilv/aframe-workshop/)

### Description
Use the JS library [`A-Frame`](https://aframe.io/) and the website deployment platform [`Netlify`](https://www.netlify.com/) to create a web app that ask to access the camera to display a 3D object on a marker printed on a sheet of paper.
